Computation of Multiscale Codependence Analysis (**MCA**)
and eigenvector maps, as an additional feature.

**MCA** is useful study the relationships between variables
that are expected to occur at specific  (spatial, temporal,
phylogenetic, and so on) scales.

**MCA** quantifies and test the joint spatial/temporal trends
between variables. These trends are described by eigenvector
maps. The analysis may involve one or more response variable(s)
and multiple scales. The explanatory variables are related to 
the response through an exclusive set of the eigenvectors in 
the map.
