\description{
\packageDescription{eigenmap}
The eigenfunctions are obtained in three steps: 1) a distance matrix is
calculated from the locations of samples in space (or the sampling
organisation through time). 2) From that distance matrix, a matrix of Moran
spatial weights is obtained; this is the same matrix as used to calculate
Moran's autocorrelation index, hence the name. And 3) the spatial weight
matrix is eigenvalue-decomposed after centring the rows and columns of the
spatial weight matrix.

\details{
Function \code{\link{eigenmap}} calculates spatial eigenvector maps
following the approach outlined in Dray et al. (2006). It returns a
\link{eigenmap-class} object. The package also features methods to print
(\code{\link{print.eigenmap}}) and plot (\code{\link{plot.eigenmap}}) these
objects. Function \code{\link{eigenmap.score}} can be used to make
predictions for spatial models built from the eigenfunctions of
\code{\link{eigenmap}} using distances between one or more target locations
and the sampled locations for which the spatial eigenvector map was built.
