\description{
A set of common distance weighting functions to calculate spatial eignevector
maps using function \code{\link{eigenmap}}.
}
\details{
These functions are meant primarily to be called within functions
\code{\link{eigenmap}} and \code{\link{eigenmap.score}}. In
\code{\link{eigenmap}}, argument \code{d} is a lower-triangular
`\link{dist}-class` object and the resulting lower-triangular weight matrix
is used in calculating the spatial eigenvector map. In
\code{\link{eigenmap.score}}, \code{d} is a rectangular matrix of the
distances between a set of arbitrary locations (rows) and reference locations
(columns; the locations for which the the spatial eigenvector map has been
built and the resulting rectangular weight matrix is used to calculate
spatial eigenfunction values. These values allow one to use the spatial
information of a data set for making predictions at arbitrary values.

`Wf.sqrd` (default value) consists in taking
\emph{w_{i,j} = -0.5*d_{i,j}} and does not involve any truncation.

`Wf.RBF` consists in taking \emph{w_{i,j} = exp(-wpar*d_{i,j}^2)} and
does not involve any truncation, where \emph{wpar} is a non-zero real
positive value (default: 1).

`Wf.binary` the spatial weighting matrix is simply the connectivity
matrix.

`Wf.PCNM` is \emph{a_{i,j} = 1 - (d_{i,j} / (wpar*boundaries_2))^2},
where \emph{wpar} is a non-zero real positive value (default: 4).
 
`Wf.Drayf1` is \emph{a_{i,j} = 1 - (d_{i,j} / d_{max})} where
\emph{d_max} is the distance between the two most distant locations in the
set.

`Wf.Drayf2` is \emph{a_{i,j} = 1 - (d_{i,j} / d_{max})^{wpar}}, where
\emph{wpar} is a non-zero real positive value (default: 1).

`Wf.Drayf3` is \emph{a_{i,j} = 1 / d_{i,j}^{wpar}}, where \emph{wpar} is a
non-zero real positive value (default: 1).

Functions \code{Wf.Drayf1}, \code{Wf.Drayf2}, and \code{Wf.Drayf3} were
proposed by Dray et al. (2006) and function \code{PCNM} was proposed by
Legendre and Legendre (2012).

The \code{Wf.sqrd} weighting approach is equivalent to submitting the
elementwise square-root of the distance matrix to a principal coordinate
analysis. It was proposed by Diniz-Filho et al. (2013) and is equivalent, for
evenly spaced transect or surfaces (square or rectangle), to using the basis
functions of type II discrete cosine basis transforms; a fact that has gone
unnoticed by Diniz-Filho et al. (2013).

The radial basis function (RBF) is a widespread kernel method involving sets
of real-valued functions whose values depend on the distance between any
given input coordinate and a set of fixed points (a single fixed point for
each function). It is implemented using function \code{Wf.RBF} using all the
sampling points as the fixed points.

When calculating the connectivity matrix, pairs of location whose distance to
one another are between the boundary values (argument \code{bounraries}) are
considered as neighbours (\emph{b_{i,j}=1}) whereas values located below the
minimum and above the maximum are considered as equivalent or distant,
respectively (\emph{b_{i,j}=0} in both cases).

User may implement custom weighting functions. These functions must at the
very least have an argument \code{d}, and can be given arguments
\code{boundaries} and \code{wpar}. Argument \code{wpar} may be a vector with
any number of elements. They should be added to the R-code file
(weighting-functions.R). User-provided weighting functions with an argument
\code{wpar} must come with a valid default value for that parameter since
\code{\link{eigenmap}} may internally call it without a formal value.
